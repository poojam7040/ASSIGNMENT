						 On Day 2, the discussion on the Women's Reservation Bill (Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam) will be continued, with the trading of barbs between the Centre and the Opposition likely to persist. Congress dubbed the introduction of the Bill as an “election jumla” and “a huge betrayal of the hopes of women”. Sonia Gandhi, the Chairperson of the Congress Parliamentary Party, will lead her party's debate on the Bill in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday.

The Women’s Reservation Bill was tabled by Union law minister Arjun Meghwal in the Lok Sabha at the new Parliament building on Tuesday.

During the first day's agenda of the five-day special session in Parliament, the Union government introduced the Bill, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying, “This historic day of 19th September 2023 is going to be immortal in the history of India.” Union law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal tabled the Bill in the inaugural sitting of the Lok Sabha in the new Parliament building. He emphasised that the government is taking a step towards women's empowerment by proposing a new Bill to reserve one-third of all seats for women in the Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies.Referring to Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was killed in June, Justin Trudeau said that he was a “Canadian citizen”, alleging a "potential link" between the Indian government and his death.

						Earlier in July, Justin Trudeau said that there is 'freedom of expression' in Canada when asked about a parade in Brampton which glorified the assassination of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. "We have an extremely diverse country and freedom of expression is something that we have, but we will always make sure that we are pushing back against violence and extremism in all its forms," the Canadian prime minister had then said, asserting, “Canada has always taken extremely seriously violence and threats of violence.”

India said that the allegations levelled by Canada are incorrect and based on unsubstantiated assumptions. The issue of deportations of wanted terrorists have been raised by Indian authorities at multiple diplomatic and security talks.</p>
